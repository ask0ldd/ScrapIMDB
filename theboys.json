        "storyline": "\"The Boys\" is set in a universe in which superpowered people are recognized as heroes by the general public and owned by a powerful corporation, Vought International, which ensures that they are aggressively marketed and monetized. Outside of their heroic personas, most are arrogant and corrupt. The series primarily focuses on two groups: the titular Boys, vigilantes looking to keep the corrupted heroes under control, and the Seven, Vought International's premier superhero team. The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all superpowered people, and the Seven are led by the egotistical and unstable Homelander. As a conflict ensues between the two groups, the series also follows the new members of each team: Hugh \"Hughie\" Campbell of the Boys, who joins the vigilantes after his girlfriend is killed in a high-speed collision by the Seven's A-Train, and Annie January/Starlight of the Seven, a hopeful young heroine forced to face the truth about the heroes she admires.",

I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because \"The Boys\" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, \"The Boys\" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching.",

            "review": "This Amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes; they aren't typical superheroes though; they work for the powerful Vought Corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives. They are also arrogant, disillusioned or generally unpleasant. The worst of these are 'The Seven', the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by Vought. Working to expose them is a group known as 'The Boys'; led by Billy Butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes, Homelander, is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. We are introduced to each group via new members; Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after ultrafast hero A-Train ran through his girlfriend; and Annie January an idealistic young heroine known as Starlight who joins The Seven. Hughie and Annie become friends before learning what the other is doing.When I first heard of this I thought it was just a case of Amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series I might like... it most certainly is! If you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than self-centred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great. Another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly; there is a lot of strong violence, some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing I've heard in a TV show. The story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development. The characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them. While the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour; often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldn't seem the most obvious source of laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different. I can't wait for season three.",

I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!",

But this scrip is so freaking impressive, the over the top violence and gore along with great dialogues and brilliant acting easily brings it to the top. i would be really surprised if the two KIWI lead protagonists, Kurl Urban and Anthony Starr wouldn't get nominated for best actors in a leading role, specially Starr. He was absolutely brilliant as the lead antagonist Homelander. That says something for a superhero movie, wouldn't you say !Was waiting patiently for this show, and living up to that hype was not easy. Had to binge it at once, it's that addictive. Wow! Before even release, Amazon Prime ordered a second season even though the production cost might have been astronomical I would imagine. They were that confident, this was that good.

            "review": "(Review updated after Season 3).Hughie Campbell's life is turned upside down when the love of his life is accidentally killed by a superhero, a member of The Seven, the most elite and adored of superhero teams. The Seven are the rock stars of the age and untouchable but the more Hughie investigates, the more he discovers they're far from perfect. His moral crusade sees him drawn into a band of anti-superhero vigilantes: The Boys.I'm generally not into superhero movies or series but this is different. Here the superheroes are more the villains than the heroes, making for a very interesting and original take on the genre. Throw in some very intriguing sub-plots involving the superheroes' private lives, the politics of their jobs and machinations within their team plus some profound observations and themes involving the (forced) superficiality of public figures, the intrusiveness and control of the media and the influence of social media status and you have a series that is original, entertaining and a mirror of the times.Action scenes are well done, with some great CGI and graphic grittiness - this is definitely not Disney! While mostly a drama there's some wonderfully funny moments too. Just about anything involving The Deep was always bound to raise a laugh.Not perfect though. The central plot - The Boys vs the superheroes - often appears clumsy and seems to go around in circles. It starts well enough but after a point, towards the end of Season 1, it just seems to get bogged down in endless escapades that have no point and occur based on the flimsiest of excuses. Plus these escapades often got resolved in silly, plot hole-riddled ways.The writers would have done better to initially concentrate on the internal machinations within The Seven with the superheroes vs The Boys plot starting as a sideshow and then amping it up as the series went on.Things do come together quite well in Season 3 though as the plot finds its focus. Season 3 is action-packed and intriguing with some great internal machinations within the superhero camp and a very interesting new character. It was heading for a fantastic showdown but the writers fluffed this somewhat in an effort to prolong the series. The final episode of S3 is a bit confusing and disappointing.All in all, it's highly entertaining viewing.Season ratings: S1&2 8/10, S3 9/10.",

Very well acted (Karl Urban gets the role of his career) and with every episode packed with twists, good characters, action, bloodshed, you name it. I bingewatch this and loved it.Review of Season Two:I was worried this one wouldn't match the first but it did. The story expands, the action and mayhem is ramped up, the new characters leave a real impression, and all of the good stuff from the first season is back. Looking forward to the third...Review of Season Three:I was a little worried about this third season when it first started. It felt like the freshness was gone to be replaced by the crudity and forced outrageousness that marred PREACHER. However, after a few episodes this finds its feet with the introduction of a great new character, some strong acting and all of the twists and political intrigue we know and love.",

But the slow pace, so many flashbacks, so many side stories that divert from the main story. I lost my interest in the season. Only 3, 6 and 8 were the good ones in season 2Season 1- 9/10\nSeason 2- 7.5/10Now let's talk about season 3. What a return back to form. Crazy from the minute go. More violent, intense and gripping than seasons 1 and 2. The addition of the V24 and Jensen Ackles as soldier boy just adds to the fun. Although Ackles enters late, he takes the spotlight the minute he entersNow, the character development is the most interesting this season. Homelander is crazier than ever. Butcher and Hughie go down a dark path. Starlight taking a huge step against Vought (really, she had enough of them). The deep coming back into the game. A-Train coming to the realization what's it like to watch one's own get hurt. MM's past with soldier boy. Really interesting developmentBelow are the episodes in season 3 I found best to worst. There is no episode I found bad, it's just the ranking I found them most interestingHerogasm (without a doubt, the best episode)Glorious five year planThe instant white hot wild (yeah, a bit rushed, but definitely not bad as everyone says it is)The only man in the sky (the ending of this episode, Oh My God!)The last time to look on this world of liesHere comes a candle to light you to bedBarbary coastPaybackComing to the performances. Antony Starr went to another level this time. This guy really deserves an emmy for this role. Karl Urban, as delicious as ever, bringing his unique style of saying sarcastic lines. Amazing. Jack Quaid got some really good scenes to shine this season and he did. Erin Moriarty proved why she will always remain the best choice to play starlight. Laz Alonso had the emotional part this season, I think he handled it well.Always lovely to hear Tomer Capon's French in every season. He doesn't disappoint. Karen Fukuhara really dominates the action scenes. She's a boss! Ackles's Soldier Boy appears late and takes the center stage in the second half. His deep voice really supports in making us believe that he is a force to be reckoned with. Cameron Covetti doesn't get much to do except the last episode. Same goes for Chace Crawford. Jessie T Usher didn't get much screen time to perform what he had to. Others do well in their partsSo. Final word, I thought season 2 was bad and it got me to lost interest in the boys and wasn't really excited to watch season 3 but I decided to give it a try and thank god I did. Just amazing. Without a doubt, the best season for me out of the trioSeason 3- 9.5/10.",
